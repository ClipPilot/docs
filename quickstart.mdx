## 1. Create an API key

Go to the [API Platform dashboard](https://platform.cuttr.com/dashboard/api-platform) and click **Create Key**. Give it a name and optionally set an expiration date.

<Warning>
  Your key is displayed **once** after creation. Copy it immediately and store it somewhere secure — you won't be able to see it again.
</Warning>

Your key will look like this:

```
cuttr_a1b2c3d4e5f6...
```

## 2. Fund your wallet

Still in the dashboard, click a top-up amount (minimum $5.00) to open a Stripe checkout. Once payment completes, your balance updates instantly.

<Tip>
  Enable **auto-refill** in the dashboard to automatically charge your saved card when your balance drops below a threshold. Never miss a request due to insufficient funds.
</Tip>

## 3. Make your first request

Test your key with the test endpoint:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X GET https://api.cuttr.com/api/platform/v1/test \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```javascript Node.js
const response = await fetch("https://api.cuttr.com/api/platform/v1/test", {
  headers: {
    "X-API-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
  },
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.cuttr.com/api/platform/v1/test",
    headers={"X-API-Key": "YOUR_API_KEY"},
)

print(response.json())
```

</CodeGroup>

If everything is set up correctly, you'll get:

```json
{
  "status": "working",
  "team_id": 42,
  "key_name": "my-first-key",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```
