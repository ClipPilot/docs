## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your API key">
    Create an API key from the [dashboard](https://platform.cuttr.com/dashboard/api-platform). Keys are shown once — store them securely.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fund your wallet">
    Add funds to your wallet. Every API call deducts from your balance. Set up auto-refill so you never run out.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make requests">
    Pass your key in the `X-API-Key` header. Each product has a fixed per-unit cost — no surprises.
  </Step>
</Steps>
